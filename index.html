Full-Stack Engineer, WordPress Specialist, AWS Architect, and Creative DIY Enthusiast
As a seasoned PHP and WordPress professional, I create custom, high-performance solutions with a full-stack approach. My expertise spans a wide array of technologies, including React, Node, AWS, MySQL, Python, and AI-driven automation. Whether it's building dynamic applications or architecting robust cloud infrastructures, I bring comprehensive technical knowledge to every project.
In addition to my engineering work, I channel creativity through publishing humor-driven comic books like <a href="https://store.florea.com/products/women-decoded">"Women Decoded: A Man's Survival Handbook"</a>, hands-on DIY projects, and building board games that reflect my passion for problem-solving and innovation.
Whether itâ€™s coding, AI, cloud architecture, or creative endeavors, I deliver results with a unique blend of professionalism and a touch of humor.
